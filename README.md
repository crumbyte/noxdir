cleanup workflow.

## 🚀 Features

  percentage

## 📦 Installation

### Pre-compiled Binaries

Obtain the latest optimized binary from
the [Releases](https://github.com/crumbyte/noxdir/releases) repository. The
application is self-contained and requires no installation process.

### Or build from source (Go 1.24+)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/crumbyte/noxdir.git
cd noxdir
make build

./bin/noxdir
```

## 🛠 Usage

Just run in the terminal:

```bash
noxdir
```

The interactive interface initializes immediately without configuration requirements.

## ⚙️ How It Works

- **Windows:** Uses `GetLogicalDrives` and `GetDiskFreeSpaceExW` through direct
  syscalls for optimal performance.
- **Linux/macOS:** Uses `statfs` and parses `/proc/mounts` or `mount` command
  output to find mounted volumes.

## 🧩 Planned Features

- [ ] Real-time filesystem event monitoring and interface updates
- [ ] Exportable reports in various formats (JSON, CSV, HTML)
- [ ] Comprehensive file management capabilities (deletion, renaming, creation operations)
- [ ] Sort directories by usage, free space, etc. (already done for
  drives)
- [ ] Customizable interface aesthetics with theme support
